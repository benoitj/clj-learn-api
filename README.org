* What is this?

A learning project to develop my clojure skills building APIs in the same landscape as spring, spring boot, spring controllers, and spring data jpa.


* Areas

** API
*** RESTful API
*** request body validation
*** error handling
** persistence
*** connect to relational db
*** mapping between DB model and API model
*** versionned DB schema
**** flyway, or migratus
**** auto provision at start
***** what happens when multiple apps starts?
** system configuration and loading
*** springboot replacement with autoconfigure
** testing
*** unit tests
*** approval tests
*** integration tests
* current problem
** TODO API and system loading [0/3]
*** TODO build a basic GET API
**** ring + compojure to build a dummy API
*** TODO use an atom as a "db"
**** protocol?
*** TODO split: controller logic (the req/res), service, persistence
